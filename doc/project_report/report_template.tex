\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

%% Motivate the problem, situation or topic you decided to work on. Describe why it matters (is it of societal, economic, scientific value?). Outline the rest of the paper (use references, e.g.~to \Cref{sec:methods}: What kind of data you are working with, how you analyse it, and what kind of conclusion you reached. The point of the introduction is to make the reader want to read the rest of the paper.

Suspendisse potenti. Curabitur dictum eget risus ut dignissim. Cras placerat tellus a aliquet sagittis. Aliquam aliquet, dui sed venenatis ultricies, nunc mauris tempus justo, a suscipit turpis turpis et nulla. Curabitur tincidunt hendrerit elementum. Suspendisse eget justo rutrum ligula suscipit scelerisque. Donec eget tincidunt enim, vitae ullamcorper dolor. Quisque consequat neque in lorem finibus iaculis. Integer sit amet leo ipsum. Sed tristique malesuada rutrum. Vestibulum purus erat, rhoncus eu erat eu, condimentum consectetur sapien. Proin id aliquet est.

% Section Introduction:
% - (status quo) Mention that self-driving cars are often motivated by an assumption that car accidents are avoidable and caused by "human error"
% - (problem with the status quo) However, human error is never clearly defined and claims that "90% of car accidents are caused by human error" have no basis to substantiate them
% - (proposed improvment) This is where our project comes in, offering a way to quantify certain preventable human error of which we can be sure that it would not be made by automated cars
% - Outline the paper
%     - Mention which data was used and to what end
%     - Mention which methods were used and to what end
% - Very briefly summarise the takeaways from the results and their implication


\section{Data and Methods}\label{sec:methods}

%% In this section, describe \emph{what you did}. Roughly speaking, explain what data you worked with, how or from where it was collected, it's structure and size. Explain your analysis, and any specific choices you made in it. Depending on the nature of your project, you may focus more or less on certain aspects. If you collected data yourself, explain the collection process in detail. If you downloaded data from the net, show an exploratory analysis that builds intuition for the data, and shows that you know the data well. If you are doing a custom analysis, explain how it works and why it is the right choice. If you are using a standard tool, it may still help to briefly outline it. Cite relevant works. You can use the \verb|\citep| and \verb|\citet| commands for this purpose \citep{mackay2003information}.

% Section Data and Methods:
% 	- Outline the section and mention the core idea of our approach
% 	Subsection Data:
%		- Introduce the data properly and in more detail (replacement for missing background section)
%		- Elaborate on aspects of the data relevant to us and tell why they're relevant
% 	Subsection Human Error:
%		- Describe our definition of human error in detail
%	Subsection Analysis:
%		- Describe our analysis on the role of human error as analysis of conditional probabilities
%		- Mention the two phases of our analysis in terms of first finding large human error correlation, and then further analysing which specific errors contribute to the high correlation
%		- Describe the actual experiments  one by one

% TODO:
% - add reference for fars, nhtsa
% - add reference for contents/documentation of the fars dataset
% - add number for total car accidents
% - add example for fars contents

In this section we present the data we considered and the methods we used to acquire our results. We first discuss the specific dataset we used, then we give an explanation of the components of the dataset we analysed and to what end. Finally we present our experiments as they emerge from our analytical goals.



\subsection{Dataset}
Out of the many possible choices for a dataset on car accidents, we decided to use the FARS2021National dataset by the USA's NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System) aims to register all fatal car accidents that occur in the USA in any given year.\\
Zoning in on fatal car accidents explicitly is useful because it avoids a discussion of what counts as an accident generally. Additionally, the number of estimated total car accidents is not only very high, but accidents are also often not reported or investigated in sufficient detail. However, these details matter, as we will later show.\\
FARS captures a large amount of information pertaining to each accident, including information about all persons and vehicles invovled in the accident, as well as circumstances of the accident itself.

\subsection{Defining Human Error}


\subsection{Experiments}



\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

%% In this section outline your results. At this point, you are just stating the outcome of your analysis. You can highlight important aspects (``we observe a significantly higher value of $x$ over $y$''), but leave interpretation and opinion to the next section. This section absoultely \emph{has} to include at least two figures.

Mauris pharetra a urna at faucibus. Donec eu justo magna. Sed viverra dolor at sapien congue, nec tempus justo aliquet. Ut et nisi id odio aliquam iaculis. Sed sit amet eros nisi. Integer dictum risus ac orci sagittis, ut dapibus mauris semper. Pellentesque ac risus quam. Morbi et orci sed mi maximus aliquet sed sit amet leo. 

% Section Results:
%	- In the same order and structure as they were outlined in Section Data and Methods, present the results
%	- Do not draw any conclusions, simply present and document figures and highlight their notable aspects


\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

%% Use this section to briefly summarize the entire text. Highlight limitations and problems, but also make clear statements where they are possible and supported by the analysis. 

Suspendisse sed arcu malesuada, tempor libero ut, hendrerit nisl. Aliquam quis elit dictum, hendrerit leo sed, tempor eros. Donec rutrum eu diam ac malesuada. Nullam non pretium velit. Sed hendrerit, magna vitae vehicula volutpat, magna risus commodo ligula, interdum iaculis metus tellus at enim. Suspendisse laoreet euismod nulla a laoreet.

% Section Discussion and Conclusion:
%	- Subsection Discussion:
%		- In the order and structure in which the experiments and results were presented, go through their implications and meaning in context
%		- At the very end, give a summarising statement combining all of the discussion into a key takeaway (or a few)
%	- Subsection Conclusion:
%		- Give a very concise summary of the paper
%		- If applicable, discuss possible future work and perspectives


\section*{Contribution Statement}

%% Explain here, in one sentence per person, what each group member contributed. For example, you could write: Max Mustermann collected and prepared data. Gabi Musterfrau and John Doe performed the data analysis. Jane Doe produced visualizations. All authors will jointly wrote the text of the report. Note that you, as a group, a collectively responsible for the report. Your contributions should be roughly equal in amount and difficulty.
Etiam aliquet hendrerit lectus porttitor placerat. Nulla ac nisl enim. Nunc vulputate augue vitae erat hendrerit tempus. Proin dolor nulla, accumsan at risus ac, volutpat bibendum nulla. Donec porttitor varius facilisis. Praesent at urna nulla. Duis eleifend nulla id quam auctor mollis. Nulla facilisi.\\

% \section*{Notes} 

% Your entire report has a \textbf{hard page limit of 4 pages} excluding references. (I.e. any pages beyond page 4 must only contain references). Appendices are \emph{not} possible. But you can put additional material, like interactive visualizations or videos, on a githunb repo (use \href{https://github.com/pnkraemer/tueplots}{links} in your pdf to refer to them). Each report has to contain \textbf{at least three plots or visualizations}, and \textbf{cite at least two references}. More details about how to prepare the report, inclucing how to produce plots, cite correctly, and how to ideally structure your github repo, will be discussed in the lecture, where a rubric for the evaluation will also be provided.
