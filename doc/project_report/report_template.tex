\begin{abstract}
%% Put your abstract here. Abstracts typically start with a sentence motivating why the subject is interesting. Then mention the data, methodology or methods you are working with, and describe results. 

X is a widely used technique, but can’t do Y. We show that X can actually be interpreted as Z, thus the wonderful technique known as $Z_Y$ can be applied to X to do Y. This means that X can now also be applied/scaled/extended to do various cool things. We demonstrate this in several experiments on real-world data from the domain of D.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

%% Motivate the problem, situation or topic you decided to work on. Describe why it matters (is it of societal, economic, scientific value?). Outline the rest of the paper (use references, e.g.~to \Cref{sec:methods}: What kind of data you are working with, how you analyse it, and what kind of conclusion you reached. The point of the introduction is to make the reader want to read the rest of the paper.

In the vivid discussion surrounding self-driving cars, a frequently made claim is that some very high percentage of car accidents is caused by "human error". This sentiment is then often used to motivate the development of automated vehicles. However, an actual definition of human error is often not stated and a numerical analysis that supports that claim not given. 
%TODO: REFERENCE.
\\
In this work, we introduce a condensed, data-driven definition of human error and analyse its occurrence on the FARS2021National dataset of fatal traffic accidents in the United States of America. The specifics of our definition and the data are elaborated below.
\\
Our analysis of the prevalence of human error shows a high prevalence of cases with human error in our data. We also observe a strong correlation between human error occurrence with certain demographics of the drivers and accident conditions.
\\
Ultimately, these results present data-driven evidence for the need for improvements in road traffic safety in the United States.

% Section Introduction:
% - (status quo) Mention that self-driving cars are often motivated by an assumption that car accidents are avoidable and caused by "human error"
% - (problem with the status quo) However, human error is never clearly defined and claims that "90% of car accidents are caused by human error" have no basis to substantiate them
% - (proposed improvment) This is where our project comes in, offering a way to quantify certain preventable human error of which we can be sure that it would not be made by automated cars
% - Outline the paper
%     - Mention which data was used and to what end
%     - Mention which methods were used and to what end
% - Very briefly summarise the takeaways from the results and their implication (contributions)

% From lecture notes:
% - Motivate the idea and the contributions
% - Would be good to have a lot of citations to undermine importance 
%	(note: scholar has a few papers on human error in general, 
%	there's a paper on the difficulties of making a good human error model,
% 	and one about motorcycles)
% - Promise, don't explain

% There is one key paper to reference: "Human error taxonomies applied to driving" on scholar
% - 15 years old, and analysis of error frequency based on data that is almost 50 years old
% - attempts very complex
% - might be able to connect this to the paper on the difficulties of making a useful error model

\section{Data and Methods}\label{sec:methods}

%% In this section, describe \emph{what you did}. Roughly speaking, explain what data you worked with, how or from where it was collected, it's structure and size. Explain your analysis, and any specific choices you made in it. Depending on the nature of your project, you may focus more or less on certain aspects. If you collected data yourself, explain the collection process in detail. If you downloaded data from the net, show an exploratory analysis that builds intuition for the data, and shows that you know the data well. If you are doing a custom analysis, explain how it works and why it is the right choice. If you are using a standard tool, it may still help to briefly outline it. Cite relevant works. You can use the \verb|\citep| and \verb|\citet| commands for this purpose \citep{mackay2003information}.

We first discuss the specific dataset we used, then we give an explanation of the components of the dataset we analysed and to what end. Finally, we present our experiments as they emerge from our analytical goals.

\subsection{Dataset}
Out of the many possible choices for a dataset on car accidents, we decided to use the FARS2021National dataset by the United States of America's NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration). The FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System) aims to register all fatal car accidents that occur in the USA in any given year.
\\
Zoning in on fatal car accidents explicitly is a useful abstraction, as it reduces ambiguity over the crash severity. Additionally, the number of estimated total car accidents is not only very high, but accidents are also often not reported or investigated in sufficient detail.
\\
FARS captures a large amount of information about each accident, including information about all persons and vehicles involved in the accident, as well as the circumstances of the accident itself. This presents a rich body of information upon which we base our analysis.

\subsection{Defining Human Error}
Human error is inherently not a strictly defined term. To reduce the inherent ambiguity, we must first come to a strict definition of what human error is. In this work, our goal is to make a selection of variables representing unnecessary risk factors that are specific to human beings.\\
This selection notably excludes risk factors that may not be preventable, such as disabilities. It furthermore disregards risk factors that do not arise from the human condition, such as the weather.\\
Finally, we choose a conservative approach of only selecting risk factors which are generally known to cause many traffic accidents. While these risk factors are not guaranteed to be the true underlying cause of the accident, they can generally be accepted as likely causes.
\\
Specific to our dataset, we consider a case to have a human error if our data indicates that one of the involved drivers was speeding, driving under influence or driving without a license. We then introduce human error as a new variable that is TRUE if one of these indicators is given and FALSE otherwise. Figure \ref{definition-venn} illustrates our definition. We will consider only this definition of human error in our analysis.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\vskip 0.2in
	\begin{center}
		\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{placeholder.png}}
		\caption{The prevalence of the variables and their values we consider human error as a percentage of all cases.}
		\label{definition-venn}
	\end{center}
	\vskip -0.2in
\end{figure}
 
We consider a case to indicate speeding if the FARS2021National dataset states that a driver was going over the speed limit. We consider it to indicate driving without a license if the dataset states that a driver did not have a valid license. Lastly, we consider it to indicate driving under influence if the dataset states the driver was under the influence, subject to the judgment of law enforcement. We do not consider cases where any of these three fields is missing from the dataset.

\subsection{Experiments}
To analyse the significance of human error and better understand how it interacts with other variables, we perform a suite of analyses over the frequencies of occurrence.
\\
First, we analyse the general prevalence of human error in our dataset. This demonstrates the overall rate of human error and the specific variables that contribute to it. Second, we investigate how human error is correlated with other variables.
\\
The FARS datasets contain a wide array of variables, many of which have no significant correlation with human error. We present several significant correlations our analysis yielded, but we do not claim completeness. A full correlation analysis with every variable in the FARS2021NationalDataset is beyond the scope of this work.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

%% In this section outline your results. At this point, you are just stating the outcome of your analysis. You can highlight important aspects (``we observe a significantly higher value of $x$ over $y$''), but leave interpretation and opinion to the next section. This section absoultely \emph{has} to include at least two figures.

\subsection{Prevalence}
Figure \ref{variable-prevalence} shows that the human error under our consideration is a common occurrence in the dataset. This statistic in and of itself urges \ldots

	\end{center}
	\vskip -0.2in
\end{figure}

\subsection{Correlations}
The variables most strongly correlated with human error are those on the driver and the conditions of the accident.
\\
We analyse the demographics of human error as a factor of age and sex. The results are illustrated in figure \ref{variable-correlation-1}. The demographic correlations show that \ldots

The time of day is another significant variable that has a significant correlation with human error, as figure \ref{variable-correlation-2} shows. We note a significant increase in human error around \ldots

\section{Discussion \& Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

%% Use this section to briefly summarize the entire text. Highlight limitations and problems, but also make clear statements where they are possible and supported by the analysis. 

In this work, we have introduced a data-driven definition of human error and demonstrated its significance based on a vast dataset of fatal car accidents.
\\
Our results demonstrate that preventable risk factors have a significant prevalence in fatal accidents. They also show that with certain demographics and under certain conditions (?) the rate of occurrence is further increased.
\\
Due to our conservative approach to variable selection, these rates of occurrence can be seen as lower bounds on what one might call the true rate of human error, which would also include difficult-to-assess factors like road rage and irresponsible driving.
\\
Finally, it's important to note that our analysis is based on traffic data that stems exclusively from the USA in the year 2021. Other countries might experience other rates of occurrence and they may change over time.
\\
Overall, the presence of significant quantities of preventable human error motivates changes in the road traffic system in the USA, whether these solutions be automotive, legislative or societal.
