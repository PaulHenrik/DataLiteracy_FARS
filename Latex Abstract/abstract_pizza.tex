\begin{abstract}
Our project is a comparison of different types of pizza in terms of their toppings, preparation and reception. Ultimately we aim to find the optimal pizza. We plan to collect the data we require for this project by organising pizza dinners, where we prepare the pizzas ourselves and invite outside judges for scoring. We came up with and chose this idea because it is something we are all passionate about. We intend to analyse correlations between the attributes of the pizzas and their reception such as the effect of the choice of toppings. Our data is limited in terms of its generalisation by the judges we employ, which specifically means students from the university dorms willing to participate. As such we expect to obtain a good picture of the preferences of this young and international demographic.

%Put your abstract here. Mention, in two sentences, what you are planning to work on. 
%Then, mention which dataset you are planning to use. Include \href{https://noaadata.apps.nsidc.org/NOAA/G02135/south/daily/data/}{a link} to the dataset you are planning to use (If you are planning to collect your own data, explain how you are going to do so). If possible, mention (one sentence) how you came across this dataset, or why you decided to do this. Explain what kind of analysis you are planning. Finally, declare which results your are expecting to achieve. Your entire abstract should be at most 20 lines long.
\end{abstract}

%We will use mostly this same template for the project report, potentially with some minor updates.

\section{Contribution Plan}
Everyone in our group will in some capacity be involved in every stage of the project. As for the immediately forseeable future, Filippo Albani and Paul-Henrik Heilmann will focus on making the pizza. Jonathan Ranck and Leon Trochelmann will focus on designing the survey and the dataset structure.

%Explain here, in one sentence per person, what each group member is going to contribute. For example, you could write: Max Mustermann is going to collect and prepare data. Gabi Musterfrau and John Doe will run the data analysis. Jane Doe is responsible for visualizations. All authors will jointly write the text of the report. Note that you, as a group, a collectively responsible for the report. Your contributions should be roughly equal in amount and difficulty.
